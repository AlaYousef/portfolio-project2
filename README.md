## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme which chosen is one based violett for main background and body text, bright orange for divs background and white for header text. These colors are compatible with each other which are consistent in style and colour and at the same time create contrast between background and foreground colours.

### Typography
The fonts chosen were 'Instrument Serif' with weight 400 Regular style for the heading. This font is attractive, so it is appropriate but not easy to read for the body text. So the body text has the default font that the browser has. This font is imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Serif/)
